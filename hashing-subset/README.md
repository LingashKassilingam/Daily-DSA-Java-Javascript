Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size m and n respectively, the task is to determine whether b[] is 
a subset of a[]. Both arrays are not sorted, and elements are distinct.

Examples: 

Input: a[] = [11, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7], b[] = [11, 3, 7, 1] 
Output: true

Input: a[] = [10, 5, 2, 23, 19], b = [19, 5, 3] 
Output: false
